; Where to poll the commands from:
PublicWebserver=https://your.server.com/
; Admin user (after you created one based on the installation instructions):
AdminUsername=admin
; Password of said admin user (make sure you it's not used anywhere else):
AdminPassword=admin

; Send server messages at least this many milliseconds apart to prevent
; accidental DoS or Cloudflare throttling:
ServerPollInterval=1500

; When multiple configuration files are present in the program directory, higher
; weights take priority.
; TL;DR: set this to 1 in the config file you want to use:
Weight=0
; CPU and GPU use the same memory (true or false):
Unified=false

[Chat]
; Where llama.cpp's CPU version is unpacked to (could be any path):
LlamaCppCPURoot=llama.cpp AVX2
; Where llama.cpp's GPU version is unpacked to (could be any path):
LlamaCppGPURoot=llama.cpp CUDA
; Use this port for chat:
LlamaCppPort=64100
; The folder where Large Language Models (LLMs) are saved (could be any path):
Models=Chat models
; If chat replies are not done in this many seconds, cancel the generation:
TextGenTimeout=90

; For each new model you want to use, just add a new Model with a number one
; more in the end than the last. At least one model is mandatory in this file.
Model1=Chat
; In SLM mode, this is the small version of each model running on the CPU:
Model1SLM=https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf

[Image generation]
; Where AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion WebUI is unpacked to (has system and
; webui subfolders, can be any path, including absolute):
WebUIRoot=Stable Diffusion WebUI 1.10.1-blackwell
; Use this port for image generation:
WebUIPort=64101
; If images are not done in this many seconds, cancel the generation:
ImageGenTimeout=60

; Base image size for non-HD generations:
ImageSize=512x512
; Image size for horizontal/landscape non-HD generations:
ImageSizeH=640x384
; Image size for vertical/portrait non-HD generations:
ImageSizeV=384x640
; Base image size for HD generations:
ImageSizeHD=1024x1024
; Image size for horizontal/landscape HD generations:
ImageSizeHDH=1138x683
; Image size for vertical/portrait HD generations:
ImageSizeHDV=683x1138

; About keywords and selectors: if they are present in a prompt, they trigger a
; change, like making the image widescreen. Keywords are single words (can't have
; spaces), but if they are found, the prompts won't change. Selectors are only
; detected if they're separated by a comma from the rest of the prompt, and will
; be removed from the final prompt that is processed.
; Keywords and selectors for making the image horizontal/landscape:
HKeywords=cinematic, landscape, scenic
HSelectors=horizontal, widescreen
; Keywords and selectors for making the image vertical/portrait:
VKeywords=portrait
VSelectors=vertical
; Keywords and selectors for making the image HD (keywords are disencouraged):
HDKeywords=
HDSelectors=4k, 8k, full HD, HD, high detail, high res, high-res, high resolution, high-resolution

; Below this line, Artist will refer to Stable Diffusion checkpoints. VoidMoA
; will swap these depending on the prompt.
; Put artists to this folder (can be any path, even absolute):
Artists=Artists
; Put negative embeddings to this folder (can be any path, even absolute):
Embeddings=Embeddings
; Default artist to use:
DefaultArtist=https://civitai.com/api/download/models/90072?type=Model&format=SafeTensor&size=pruned&fp=fp16
; Things not to have in the images (embedding files also work):
DefaultNegative=https://civitai.com/api/download/models/77169?type=Model&format=PickleTensor, nsfw, erotic

; Additional artists begin here. For each artist, there are 3 variables:
; - ArtistX - download path to the Stable Diffusion checkpoint file
; - ArtistXKeywords - if a keyword is present in the prompt, artist is selected
; - ArtistXSelector - if one is comma-separated in the prompt, artist is selected
; - ArtistXNegative - negative prompt, links for negative embedding downloads
; Selectors are removed from the prompt and can have spaces. keywords remain, but
; can't have spaces. Either list can be empty.
; If you want to add another artist with its keywords and selectors, just add new
; variables of the same names with a one larger number.
